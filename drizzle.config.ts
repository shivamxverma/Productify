/*
Why Use Drizzle Kit?
Type Safety: Drizzle Kit ensures that your SQL queries, models, and migrations are type-safe, reducing potential errors in production.
Modern Development: It leverages modern JavaScript and TypeScript features, making it more appealing to developers accustomed to these environments.
Efficient and Lightweight: If you need a performant ORM that doesnâ€™t compromise on features but avoids the overhead of traditional ORMs, Drizzle Kit can be a good fit.
